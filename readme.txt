History manager is a widget that shows archives, categories, tags, recent posts, and recent comments in a collapsable mode on the sidebar.

== Description ==

Tired of having your post history taking up your entire sidebar? With History Manager, all of the activity and archives of your blog are displayed in one widget that allows visitors to unfold whatever they want to see and hide what they don't care about.

The widget will display correctly with or without Javascript, but the accordion display won't work unless Javascript is on.

== Installation ==

= First time installation instructions =

   1. Unzip and upload the php file to your wordpress plugin directory
   2. Activate the plugin
   3. Go to the Design > Widgets - Drag the widget into a sidebar and save!
   
= Configuration =

You can change the title of the widget and the title of each category in the widget using the widget options panel. You can also disable certain categories or make them open by default.

== Screenshots ==

1. Widget Display
2. Admin Options Panel

== Changelog ==

= 3.1.1 = 
Fixed a silly CSS error.

= 3.1 =
Fixed a display issue where custom titles weren't displaying.
Also created a better Admin UI.

= 3.0 =
Built a better accordion method instead of using jQuery UI.
Now you can choose what categories are open by default.

= 2.5.2 =
Finally fixed a problem where the Javascript wasn't working in some themes.

= 2.5.1 =
Fixed a problem in the admin area that broke the widget page. Thanks to GaMeR for this fix!

= 2.5 =
Fixed an XHTML compliancy issue, added the option of how many posts you want displayed. Tags are a new option.

= 2.2 =
The plugin now uses the WP Widget function, and therefore requires the 2.8 branch.

= 2.0 =
I removed all of the AJAX functions, since they weren't really necessary and were causing issues with some users. Integrated the plugin with jQuery Accordion. Added a new control panel that allows you to decide what will be shown.

= 1.1 =
I fixed a few things that were left out of the initial release, hopefully it is now easier to use with your Wordpress site.
