History manager is a widget that shows archives, categories, recent posts, and recent categories in a collapsable mode on the sidebar.

== Description ==

Tired of having your post history taking up your entire sidebar? With History Manager, your recent posts, recent comments, archvies by month, and categories are displayed in one widget that allows visitors to unfold whatever they want to see and hide what they don't care about.

It uses jQuery's Accordion method, but doesn't look horrible when Javascript is turned off (not that that will matter for 99.9% of your visitors).

== Installation ==

= First time installation instructions =

   1. Unzip and upload the php file to your wordpress plugin directory
   2. Activate the plugin
   3. Go to the Design > Widgets - Drag the widget into a sidebar and save!
   
= Configuration =

The title of the widget and what gets displayed (ex. show or don't show 'Recent Posts') can be changed through the menu on the 'Widgets' page.

== Screenshots ==

== Changelog ==

Update 1.1: I fixed a few things that were left out of the initial release, hopefully it is now easier to use with your Wordpress site.

Update 2.0: I removed all of the AJAX functions, since they weren't really necessary and were causing issues with some users. Integrated the plugin with jQuery Accordion. Added a new control panel that allows you to decide what will be shown.
