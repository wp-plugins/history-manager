History manager is a widget that shows archives, categories, recent posts, and recent categories all in one widget on the sidebar.

== Description ==

Allows your visitors to see your old posts by category, by month, by most recent, and shows your most recent comments, all powered with some AJAX so it loads when your visitor wants it. It also has DHTML included for a cool sliding effect.

Update 1.1: I fixed a few things that were left out of the initial release, hopefully it is now easier to use with your Wordpress site.

== Installation ==

= First time installation instructions =

   1. Unzip and upload the php file to your wordpress plugin directory

   3. Go to the Design > Widgets - Drag the widget into a sidebar and save!

The title of the widget and background color of the return box can be changed through the menu on the 'Widgets' page.
